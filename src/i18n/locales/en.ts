    whatBody: "SIT-CARE is an innovative software tool for analyzing social interaction. Participants engage in a video-based dialogue with an actress and are recorded during the process. The conversation covers various topics designed to elicit emotional and social responses.",
    howTitle: "How does SIT-CARE work?",
    howBody: "The software automatically recognizes and analyzes behavioral markers such as facial expressions, gaze direction, head movements, and voice prosody. The results are presented as visualizations or AI-based recommendations.",
