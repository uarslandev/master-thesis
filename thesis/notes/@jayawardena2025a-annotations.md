"Colour was the most frequently used interface design feature to signal the presence of deterioration with half of colour-coded dashboards using a traffic light schema to classify patient risk level."


<mark style="background-color: #ffd400">Quote</mark>
"Clinicians preferred dashboards that included both graphs and tables."

"Clinicians have expressed that they were disinclined to use CDS systems with manual recording of vital signs and high alert frequency."


<mark style="background-color: #ffd400">Quote</mark>
"Several factors contribute to low CDS uptake, such as lack of knowledge or confidence with the CDS system, workflow disruption and CDS usability, including poor CDS system design [6–8]"

"Furthermore, difficulty in switching between displays, visual screen clutter, and inability to customise information have also been shown to contribute to decreased clinician satisfaction"
