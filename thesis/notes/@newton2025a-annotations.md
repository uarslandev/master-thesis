> Abstract
            Existing reviews have identified factors influencing Clinical Decision Support (CDS) adoption by clinicians in practice but overlook the dynamic and evolving nature of technology and users’ needs over time. This review aimed to identify factors that influence early, mid-term, and sustained acceptance and use of CDS in hospital settings. Five databases were searched from 2007 to January 2024 and 67 papers were included. Factors were extracted and synthesised according to the time that data were collected following CDS implementation. Factors relating to the CDS intervention (e.g. utility) and inner setting (e.g. fit with workflows) were reported across all time periods. Perceived outcomes were more often identified in the first year of use, and individual factors after the first 6 months of use. Strategies to work around CDS limitations were reported 5 years after implementation. Our review provides guidance for developing, implementing, and supporting ongoing use of CDS systems.

"However, the impact of CDS on workflows and clinical outcomes is generally reported to be low in practice"

> Low impact in practice


<mark style="background-color: #ffd400">Quote</mark>
"Clinicians’ uptake of CDS, an essential step to realising these outcomes, was recently reported to be just 34.2% in a meta-analysis conducted across 60 CDS study arms"

> Adoption Rates


<mark style="background-color: #ffd400">Quote</mark>
"Factors commonly reported include the systems’ usefulness and ease of use, its fit with existing workflows, and the provision of resources to support users"

> Workflow Fit

"evidence indicates that CDS use is likely to be a dynamic process where user needs unfold and change over time."
