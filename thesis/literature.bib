  abstract = {Abstract                            Background               Clinical decision support systems (CDSS) have the potential to play a crucial role in enhancing health care quality by providing evidence-based information to clinicians at the point of care. Despite their increasing popularity, there is a lack of comprehensive research exploring their design characterization and trends. This limits our understanding and ability to optimize their functionality, usability, and adoption in health care settings.                                         Objective               This systematic review examined the design characteristics of CDSS from a user-centered perspective, focusing on user-centered design (UCD), user experience (UX), and usability, to identify related design challenges and provide insights into the implications for future design of CDSS.                                         Methods               This review followed the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) recommendations and used a grounded theory analytical approach to guide the conduct, data analysis, and synthesis. A search of 4 major electronic databases (PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, and IEEE Xplore) was conducted for papers published between 2013 and 2023, using predefined design-focused keywords (design, UX, implementation, evaluation, usability, and architecture). Papers were included if they focused on a designed CDSS for a health condition and discussed the design and UX aspects (eg, design approach, architecture, or integration). Papers were excluded if they solely covered technical implementation or architecture (eg, machine learning methods) or were editorials, reviews, books, conference abstracts, or study protocols.                                         Results               Out of 1905 initially identified papers, 40 passed screening and eligibility checks for a full review and analysis. Analysis of the studies revealed that UCD is the most widely adopted approach for designing CDSS, with all design processes incorporating functional or usability evaluation mechanisms. The CDSS reported were mainly clinician-facing and mostly stand-alone systems, with their design lacking consideration for integration with existing clinical information systems and workflows. Through a UCD lens, four key categories of challenges relevant to CDSS design were identified: (1) usability and UX, (2) validity and reliability, (3) data quality and assurance, and (4) design and integration complexities. Notably, a subset of studies incorporating Explainable artificial intelligence highlighted its emerging role in addressing key challenges related to validity and reliability by fostering explainability, transparency, and trust in CDSS recommendations, while also supporting collaborative validation with users.                                         Conclusions               While CDSS show promise in enhancing health care delivery, identified challenges have implications for their future design, efficacy, and utilization. Adopting pragmatic UCD design approaches that actively involve users is essential for enhancing usability and addressing identified UX challenges. Integrating with clinical systems is crucial for interoperability and presents opportunities for AI-enabled CDSS that rely on large patient data. Incorporating emerging technologies such as Explainable Artificial Intelligence can boost trust and acceptance. Enabling functionality for CDSS to support both clinicians and patients can create opportunities for effective use in virtual care.},

  abstract = {This study reports the findings of qualitative interview sessions conducted with ICU clinicians for the co-design of a system user interface of an artificial intelligence (AI)-driven clinical decision support (CDS) system. This system integrates medical record data with wearable sensor, video, and environmental data into a real-time dynamic model that quantifies patients' risk of clinical decompensation and risk of developing delirium, providing actionable alerts to augment clinical decision-making in the ICU setting. Co-design sessions were conducted as semi-structured focus groups and interviews with ICU clinicians, including physicians, mid-level practitioners, and nurses. Study participants were asked about their perceptions on AI-CDS systems, their system preferences, and were asked to provide feedback on the current user interface prototype. Session transcripts were qualitatively analyzed to identify key themes related to system utility, interface design features, alert preferences, and implementation considerations. Ten clinicians participated in eight sessions. The analysis identified five themes: (1) AI's computational utility, (2) workflow optimization, (3) effects on patient care, (4) technical considerations, and (5) implementation considerations. Clinicians valued the CDS system's multi-modal continuous monitoring and AI's capacity to process large volumes of data in real-time to identify patient risk factors and suggest action items. Participants underscored the system's unique value in detecting delirium and promoting non-pharmacological delirium prevention measures. The actionability and intuitive interpretation of the presented information was emphasized. ICU clinicians recognize the potential of an AI-driven CDS system for ICU delirium and acuity to improve patient outcomes and clinical workflows.},

Clinical decision support (CDS) has the potential to aid clinicians in identifying patients who could benefit from medication changes. This study designed an alert to control hypertension in CKD patients using an iterative human-centered design process.                                         Methods               In this study, we present a human-centered design process employing multiple methods for gathering user requirements and feedback on design and usability.

  abstract = {Purpose: To investigate differences between rating of perceived exertion (RPE) and percentage one-repetition maximum (1RM) load assignment in resistance-trained males (19-35yrs) performing protocols with matched sets and repetitions differentiated by load-assignment. Methods: Participants performed squats then bench press 3x/wk in a daily undulating format over 8-weeks. Participants were counterbalanced by pre-test 1RM then assigned to percentage 1RM (1RMG, n = 11); load-assignment via percentage 1RMs, or RPE groups (RPEG, n = 10); participant-selected loads to reach target RPE ranges. Ultrasonography determined pre and post-test pectoralis (PMT), and vastus lateralis muscle thickness at 50 (VLMT50) and 70\% (VLMT70) femur-length. Results: Bench press (1RMG +9.64 ± 5.36; RPEG +10.70 ± 3.30 kg), squat (1RMG +13.91 ± 5.89; RPEG +17.05 ± 5.44 kg) and their combined-total 1RMs (1RMG +23.55 ± 10.38; RPEG +27.75 ± 7.94 kg) increased (p  0.05). Magnitude-based inferences revealed 79, 57, and 72\% chances of mean small effect size (ES) advantages for squat; ES 90\% confidence limits (CL) = 0.50 ± 0.63, bench press; ES 90\% CL = 0.28 ± 0.73, and combined-total; ES 90\% CL = 0.48 ± 0.68 respectively, in RPEG. There were 4, 14 and 6\% chances 1RMG had a strength advantage of the same magnitude, and 18, 29 and 22\% chances, respectively of trivial differences between groups. Conclusions: Both loading-types are effective. However, RPE-based loading may provide a small 1RM strength advantage in a majority of individuals.},

  abstract = {Human-AI collaboration is increasingly promoted to improve high-stakes decision-making, yet its benefits have not been fully realized. Application-grounded evaluations are needed to better evaluate methods for improving collaboration but often require domain experts, making studies costly and limiting their generalizability. Current evaluation methods are constrained by limited public datasets and reliance on proxy tasks. To address these challenges, we propose an application-grounded framework for large-scale, online evaluations of vision-based decision-making tasks. The framework introduces Blockies, a parametric approach for generating datasets of simulated diagnostic tasks, offering control over the traits and biases in the data used to train real-world models. These tasks are designed to be easy to learn but difficult to master, enabling participation by non-experts. The framework also incorporates storytelling and monetary incentives to manipulate perceived task stakes. An initial empirical study demonstrated that the high-stakes condition significantly reduced healthy distrust of AI, despite longer decision-making times. These findings underscore the importance of perceived stakes in fostering healthy distrust and demonstrate the framework's potential for scalable evaluation of high-stakes Human-AI collaboration.},

The median effect of intelligent tutoring in the 50 evaluations was to raise test scores 0.66 standard deviations over conventional levels, or from the 50th to the 75th percentile. However, the amount of improvement found in an evaluation depended to a great extent on whether improvement was measured on locally developed or standardized tests, suggesting that alignment of test and instructional objectives is a critical determinant of evaluation results. The review also describes findings from two groups of evaluations that did not meet all of the selection requirements for the meta-analysis: six evaluations with nonconventional control groups and four with flawed implementations of intelligent tutoring systems. Intelligent tutoring effects in these evaluations were small, suggesting that evaluation results are also affected by the nature of control treatments and the adequacy of program implementations.},

However, the impact of clinician involvement on CDS acceptance and use in practice has not been systematically studied. This review aimed to identify the approaches taken to involve clinicians in CDS development and understand the impact of these approaches on barriers and facilitators to acceptance and use in hospital settings over time. Twenty-three studies met full inclusion criteria. Clinician involvement was rarely described in depth and no comparative studies were identified. Despite frequently reporting perceived ease of use, included studies still reported barriers to acceptance and use shortly after CDS implementation and years later. Future studies should report clinician involvement in adequate detail to enable understanding of its impact on CDS acceptance and use over time. Additional recommendations for future research, including conducting comparative studies and maintaining clinician involvement beyond implementation, are described.},

  abstract = {eXplainable AI (XAI) involves two intertwined but separate challenges: the development of techniques to extract explanations from black-box AI models and the way such explanations are presented to users, i.e., the explanation user interface. Despite its importance, the second aspect has received limited attention so far in the literature. Effective AI explanation interfaces are fundamental for allowing human decision-makers to take advantage and oversee high-risk AI systems effectively. Following an iterative design approach, we present the first cycle of prototyping-testing-redesigning of an explainable AI technique and its explanation user interface for clinical Decision Support Systems (DSS). We first present an XAI technique that meets the technical requirements of the healthcare domain: sequential, ontology-linked patient data, and multi-label classification tasks. We demonstrate its applicability to explain a clinical DSS, and we design a first prototype of an explanation user interface. Next, we test such a prototype with healthcare providers and collect their feedback with a two-fold outcome: First, we obtain evidence that explanations increase users’ trust in the XAI system, and second, we obtain useful insights on the perceived deficiencies of their interaction with the system, so we can re-design a better, more human-centered explanation interface.},

  abstract = {Despite widespread adoption, machine learning models remain mostly black boxes. Understanding the reasons behind predictions is, however, quite important in assessing trust, which is fundamental if one plans to take action based on a prediction, or when choosing whether to deploy a new model. Such understanding also provides insights into the model, which can be used to transform an untrustworthy model or prediction into a trustworthy one. In this work, we propose LIME, a novel explanation technique that explains the predictions of any classifier in an interpretable and faithful manner, by learning an interpretable model locally around the prediction. We also propose a method to explain models by presenting representative individual predictions and their explanations in a non-redundant way, framing the task as a submodular optimization problem. We demonstrate the flexibility of these methods by explaining different models for text (e.g. random forests) and image classification (e.g. neural networks). We show the utility of explanations via novel experiments, both simulated and with human subjects, on various scenarios that require trust: deciding if one should trust a prediction, choosing between models, improving an untrustworthy classifier, and identifying why a classifier should not be trusted.},

  abstract = {Today, virtual reality and immersive environments are lines of research which can be applied to numerous scientific and educational domains. Immersive digital media needs new approaches regarding its interactive and immersive features, which means the design of new narratives and relationships with users. Additionally, ICT (information and communication theory) evolves through more immersive and interactive scenarios, it being necessary to design and conceive new forms of representing information and improving users’ interaction with immersive environments. Virtual reality and technologies associated with the virtuality continuum, such as immersive and digital environments, are emerging media. As a medium, this approach may help to build and represent ideas and concepts, as well as developing new languages. This review analyses the cutting-edge expressive, interactive and representative potential of immersive digital technologies. It also considers future possibilities regarding the evolution of these immersive technologies, such as virtual reality, in coming years, in order to apply them to diverse scientific, artistic or informational and educational domains. We conclude that virtual reality is an ensemble of technological innovations, but also a concept, and propose models to link it with the latest in other domains such as UX (user experience), interaction design. This concept can help researchers and developers to design new experiences and conceive new expressive models that can be applied to a wide range of scientific lines of research and educational dynamics.},

  abstract = {Autism Spectrum Condition (ASC) is characterized by social interaction difficulties that can be challenging to assess objectively in the diagnostic process. In this paper, we evaluate the capability of using videos of a standardized social interaction to differentiate non-verbal behaviors of individuals with and without ASC. We collected a large video dataset consisting of 164 participants with ASC (n = 83) and neurotypical individuals (n = 81) who completed the computer-based Simulated Interaction Task (SIT) in different studies including lab and home settings. To classify individuals with and without ASC, we trained uni-and multimodal machine learning models based on different modalities such as facial expressions, gaze behavior, head pose and voice features. Our results indicate that a multimodal late fusion approach achieved the highest accuracy (74\%). In the unimodal setting, classification based on facial expressions (accuracy 73\%) and voice features (accuracy 70\%) were most effective. An explainability analysis of the most relevant features for the facial expression model indicated that features from all emotional parts as well as from both the speaking and listening part of the interaction were informative. Based on our results, we developed a scalable online version of the SIT to collect diverse data on a large scale for the development of machine learning models that can differentiate between different clinical conditions. Our study highlights the potential of machine learning on videos of standardized social interactions in supporting clinical diagnosis and the objective and effective measurement of differences in social interaction behavior.},

  abstract = {Due to the complex and resource-intensive nature of diagnosing Autism Spectrum Condition (ASC), several computer-aided diagnostic support methods have been proposed to detect autism by analyzing behavioral cues in patient video data. While these models show promising results on some datasets, they struggle with poor gaze feature performance and lack of real-world generalizability. To tackle these challenges, we analyze a standardized video dataset comprising 168 participants with ASC (46\% female) and 157 non-autistic participants (46\% female), making it, to our knowledge, the largest and most balanced dataset available. We conduct a multimodal analysis of facial expressions, voice prosody, head motion, heart rate variability (HRV), and gaze behavior. To address the limitations of prior gaze models, we introduce novel statistical descriptors that quantify variability in eye gaze angles, improving gaze-based classification accuracy from 64\% to 69\% and aligning computational findings with clinical research on gaze aversion in ASC. Using late fusion, we achieve a classification accuracy of 74\%, demonstrating the effectiveness of integrating behavioral markers across multiple modalities. Our findings highlight the potential for scalable, video-based screening tools to support autism assessment.},

  abstract = {A variety of methods exist to explain image classification models. However, whether they provide any benefit to users over simply comparing various inputs and the model's respective predictions remains unclear. We conducted a user study (N=240) to test how such a baseline explanation technique performs against concept-based and counterfactual explanations. To this end, we contribute a synthetic dataset generator capable of biasing individual attributes and quantifying their relevance to the model. In a study, we assess if participants can identify the relevant set of attributes compared to the ground-truth. Our results show that the baseline outperformed concept-based explanations. Counterfactual explanations from an invertible neural network performed similarly as the baseline. Still, they allowed users to identify some attributes more accurately. Our results highlight the importance of measuring how well users can reason about biases of a model, rather than solely relying on technical evaluations or proxy tasks. We open-source our study and dataset so it can serve as a blue-print for future studies. For code see, https://github.com/berleon/do\_users\_benefit\_from\_interpretable\_vision},

  abstract = {Abstract                            Background               Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a chronic neurodevelopmental condition with a prevalence rate above 1\%, characterized by deficits in social communication and interaction; restrictive, repetitive patterns of behavior, interests, or activities; and a preference for sameness and routines. The majority of adult ASD patients suffer from comorbid conditions such as depression and anxiety. Therapy options for adult ASD patients are lacking, with presently no available evidence-based interventions in Germany. Recently, two interventions to improve social responsiveness have been published. FASTER (“Freiburger Asperger-Spezifische Therapie für ERwachsene” = Freiburg Asperger-specific therapy for adults) is a manualized group psychotherapy program including three modules on psychoeducation, stress regulation management, and non-verbal and verbal social communication training with videotaped tasks. SCOTT\&EVA (“Social Cognition Training Tool”, and its enhancement “Emotionen Verstehen und Ausdruecken” = understanding and expressing emotions) is a computer-based training program to enhance social cognition including video and audio material of emotional expressions and complex real-life social situations. Initial studies for both programs have shown good feasibility and efficacy.                                         Methods               Three hundred sixty adult participants with an autism spectrum disorder (ASD) will take part in a randomized controlled three-armed multi-center trial to prove the efficacy of manualized group psychotherapy and a manualized computer-based training program. Both interventions will be compared with a treatment as usual (TAU) group, aiming to establish evidence-based psychotherapy approaches for adult individuals with ASD. The primary outcome is evaluated by parents, spouses, or others who have sufficient insight into the respective participant’s social communication and interaction, and will be measured with the Social Responsiveness Scale. First, each of both interventions will be compared to TAU. If at least one of the differences is significant, both interventions will be compared against each other. The primary outcome will be measured at baseline (T0) and 4~months after baseline (T1).                                         Discussion               The trial is the first to validate psychiatric therapeutic and training interventions for adult ASD patients in Germany. A trial is needed because the prevalence of ASD in adulthood without intellectual disability is high, and no evidence-based intervention can be offered in Germany.
